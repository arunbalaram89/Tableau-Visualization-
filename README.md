# REPORT ANALYSIS

The report uses the 2015 and 2020 data. With both years, there was a significant jump in the 5 years. The trend of the NYC bike program is continuously improving. The 2023 datasets were well over 2 million records in each file. This shows the popularity of the the bike share program.

The visualizations looked at the starting point and ending points of the average bike ride. Most of the dataset were from New Yorkers that are subscribers, and very few pay-as-you-go customers. Because New York is very dense, and travelling by car or transit can be a hassle, the bike share program is quite efficient. I also looked at the distinct BikeIDs to not overcrowd the data. This way, I would be able to have a better understanding of how the data were spread out all through New York. 

2015 Data

With the 2015 data, I wanted to see the ridership, in particular, grouping by their group year to get a better demographic. This way we can who or what particular demographic likes riding bikes. The younger generation seemed to have died down significantly after 1990. It seems that the bike program is quite popular for demographics up to millenlials. Next, I looked at the most popular stations for starting and ending in New York for this year. It turns out, popular tourist areas are also a high demand for the bike program. In New York City, a more popular location can lead to more traffic, which may be a reason for heavy usage of bikes.

2020 Data 

With the 2020 data, just as 2015, I wanted to build on the demographic model. For the starting stations in New York, I also filtered by Birth Year and Bike ID. By the colour gradient, we can see that this shows a heavy usage of people born in 1975 to 1990. With a significant drop for late 1990s are early 2000s. In terms of the subsribers, I can see that subscribers were born in the year 1969. This was quite surprising to me, as a lot of older citizens deciding to take up cycling. This may be due to wanting better health, the pandemic, and more longevity down the road. 

Lastly, I was debating using the 2023 dataset, but due to the significant size of the data, it was quite large. However, if there was to be a prediction, I would see an increase in the bike share program, and maybe a small uptick in Generation Z taking part in the bike share program.
